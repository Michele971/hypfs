## NOTES

### You have to run the project on Ethereum Consensus Network

### The final version of smart contract will not contains the location for privacy reasons. Instead hash of the proof and signed hash of the proof will be inserted by the provers

### Info

At the moment, the following system contains 8 prover where 2 are creators and 6 are the neighbours.
In particular:
- **1° Smart contract associated to 7H369F4W+Q8 location:** prover with DID 2 is the creator and his neighbours are 6, 50 and 51;
- **2° Smart contract associated to 7H369F4W+Q9 location:** prover with DID 8 is the creator and his neighbours are 9, 10 and 11.

The verifier has a balance equal to 1500 and sends 500 eth to both smart contracts.
Ther verifier will also verify all the proof and location inside the smart contracts.

## Main Features

- [Open Location Code](https://www.placekey.io/blog/google-maps-plus-codes-location-keys)
- Reach
- Python

##  Run

You have to [install Reach](https://docs.reach.sh/quickstart/) and start the docker. 
To run the **index.py** script, use:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `pip install --upgrade reach-rpc-client`
- `./reach rpc-run python3 -u ./index.py`

If you want to try the simulation use:
- `./reach rpc-run python3 -u ./startSimulation.py`

## How it works

- **index.rsh**: Smart Contract backend code;
- **index.py**: Frontend code (that interact with Smart Contract backend code);
- **startSimulation**: Simulation script that will call functions inside index.py to interact with Smart Contract.

Some functionalities of scripts; initial interactions between Deployer and Prover:

## If issues comes ...
Try with
- `./reach down`
- `./reach update`

## Test on Ganache:
- `REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE=ETH-live ETH_NODE_URI=http://host.docker.internal:7545 REACH_ISOLATED_NETWORK=1 ./reach rpc-run python3 -u startSimulation.py`
